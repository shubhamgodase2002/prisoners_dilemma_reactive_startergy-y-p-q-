Abstract:
This study examines the Prisoner's Dilemma within game theory, focusing on the Reactive Strategy. Unlike static approaches, the Reactive Strategy adapts based on the opponent's actions, offering a dynamic response mechanism. Through simulations, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining cooperation and handling diverse strategies, including random and zero-determinant (ZD) approaches.

Conclusion:
The Reactive Strategy outperforms rigid strategies like Grim Trigger by flexibly adjusting to the opponentâ€™s actions. Its adaptability enables sustained cooperation and better long-term payoffs, making it more effective in complex, unpredictable environments.
